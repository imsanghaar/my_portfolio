# About Me

Hi, I am **Imam Sanghaar Chandio**, a passionate Frontend Web Developer and certified Prompt & Context Engineer, currently residing in **Karachi, Pakistan**. I specialize in building dynamic, user-friendly websites and leveraging the power of Agentic AI to automate workflows and solve complex problems.

This entire portfolio website, or my "digital book," is a testament to the power of AI Agents. I, Imam Sanghaar Chandio, don't write the code directly; instead, I utilize advanced prompting techniques, especially with tools like speckitplus, to instruct AI Agents to generate and develop these web experiences and other projects. This approach highlights my expertise in guiding AI to create sophisticated and functional digital solutions.
